NTDS project : Twitter users gender classification

TA's comment : 
	* Well defined as a Kaggle competition.
	* How do you choose which users to collect tweets from ? Be careful of bias in training data. Anyway you should do this at the end. Work on the model first.
	* By "extraction of relevant features", you mean hand-crafted features to be fed to a classifier ?
	* Which algorithm will you test first for classification ?
	* What will you do for data exploration ?
	* Would be interesting to see which of text or profile picture has the most predictive power.
