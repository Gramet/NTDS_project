One last shot at me.Are we living in Nazi Germany? I win an election easily, a great ""movement"" is verified, and crooked opponents try to belittle our victory with FAKE NEWS. A sorry state! Russia has never tried to use leverage over me. I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH RUSSIA - NO DEALS, NO LOANS, NO NOTHING!

Only reason the hacking of the poorly defended DNC is discussed is that the loss by the Dems was so big that they are totally embarrassed!

The dishonest media does not report that any money spent on building the Great Wall (for sake of speed), will be paid back by Mexico later! So how and why are they so sure about hacking if they never even requested an examination of the computer servers? What is going on?

Thank you to Ford for scrapping a new plant in Mexico and creating 700 new jobs in the U.S. This is just the beginning - much more to follow ""@FoxNews: Julian Assange on U.S. media coverage: “It’s very dishonest.” #Hannity https://t.co/ADcPRQifH9"" More dishonest than anyone knows Julian Assange said ""a 14 year old could have hacked Podesta"" - why was DNC so careless? Also said Russians did not give him the info! The ""Intelligence"" briefing on so-called ""Russian hacking"" was delayed until Friday, perhaps more time needed to build a case. Very strange!
