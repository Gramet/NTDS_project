This datasets contains 20000 entries, each of them being a tweet from different users, with many other associated features which are listed here:\n",

    "* **_unit_id** : a unique id for each user\n",
    "* **_golden** : a boolean which states whether the user is included in the golden standard for the model\n",

    "* **_trusted_judgments** : the number of judgment on a user's gender. 3 for non-golden, or a unique id for golden\n",
    "* **_last_judgment_at** : date and time of the last judgment, blank for golden observations\n",
    "* **gender** : either *male*, *female* or *brand* for non-human profiles\n",

    "* **profile_yn** : either *yes* or *no*, *no* meaning that the user's profile was not available when contributors went to judge it\n",
    "* **profile_yn:confidence** : confidence in the existence/non-existence of the profile\n",
    "* **created** : date and time of when the profile was created\n",
    "* **description** : the user's Tweeter profile description\n",
    "* **fav_number** : the amount of favorited tweets by the user\n",
    "* **gender_gold** : the gender if the profile is golden\n",
    "* **link_color** : the link color of the profile as a hex value\n",
    "* **name** : the Tweeter user's name\n",
    "* **profile_yn_gold** : *yes* or *no* whether the profile y/n value is golden\n",
    "* **profileimage** : a link to the profile image\n",
    "* **retweet_count** : the number of times the user has retweeted something\n",
    "* **sidebar_color** : color of the profile sidebar as a hex value\n",
    "* **text** : text of a random tweet from the user\n",
    "* **tweet_coord** : if the location was available at the time of the tweet, the coordinates as a string ith the format[latitude, longitude]\n",
    "* **tweet_count** : number of tweet of the users\n",
    "* **tweet_created** : the time of the random tweet in **text**\n",
